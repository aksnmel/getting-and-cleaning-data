Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The files are present under the folder `/User/MyPrinshu/data science` un-compressed and original names.

The working directory has been set to `/User/MyPrinshu/data science. This has been done to execute the R code
on any system by setting the target folder and preparing working directory.

Beyond this the file paths are being used as convinience to use the file.path function.



`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called `averages_data.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.
